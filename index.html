    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Katerina Ramirez, a third-year undergraduate Physics major at California State University, Long Beach.
        My journey into the world of physics began with a fascination for understanding the fundamental laws governing the universe. 
	After receiving my Associate's degrees in Physics and Business Administration.
        As I progress through my studies, I find myself increasingly drawn to the intricate realms of theoretical physics,
        particularly exploring the mysteries of particle physics and quantum mechanics.

        My academic pursuits are not limited to the classroom; I am conducting research involving magnetoresistors under the supervision of my mentors
	and searching for more theory-based experience in particle physics. In pursuit of community after my transfer to CSULB, I have become active in many organizations and clubs. 
	Leaderships roles suit my style of education, so I have become the Vice President of Astronomy Club and Publicist for the Women in Physics Club (WiP)
	Furthermore, I plan on joining the board of the Society of Physics Students (SPS) Chapter next semester. In the upcoming semester, 
	I also plan to branch out and join clubs that align with my interests aside from physics. Most notably, my goals are to try out and
	become a part of the League of Legends Team for the ESports Association at CSULB. 
 	Outside of academics, I enjoy attending conferences, performing arts, and ESports.
	With a strong determination and dedication to my studies, I look forward to making meaningful contributions to the field of physics and beyond.
    </p>
